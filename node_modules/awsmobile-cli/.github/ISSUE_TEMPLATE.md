Important: The AWS Mobile CLI is in maintanence mode. If you are building a new mobile or web app, or you're adding cloud capabilities to your existing app, use the new AWS Amplify CLI instead. Use this template to report bugs. For new feature requests refer to the aws-amplify/amplify-cli repository.
